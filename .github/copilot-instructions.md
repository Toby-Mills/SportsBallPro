## Code Standards

### Required Before Each Commit
- Ensure all code is formatted using Prettier.
- Run all unit tests and ensure they pass.
- Keep console.log messages to a minimum, using them only for debugging purposes.

### Repository Structure
- Follow Angular's recommended project structure.
- Keep components, services, and modules organized in their respective directories.

### Angular Best Practices
- Use standalone components where appropriate.
- Use separate files for component styles and templates.

## AI Agents Usage
- If the user asks for the AI Agent to makes changes, but the agent is in a mode that does not support making those edits directly, the agent should respond with a message indicating that it cannot make the changes directly, and suggest that the user change the agent mode rather than write out instructions.
